### Welcome to my Git
This is my Git. 

### Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these file a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

### Using Git 

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/`, with `~/projex` as a symlink.) The script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anhthanh96vp/node-vue-x2js.git
